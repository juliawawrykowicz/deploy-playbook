    CoreWeave has developed strategic access points to key colocation data centers, where it can connect directly to customer networks. Zoom in to explore every location further.

With a strong presence across key U.S. markets, including New Jersey, Illinois, Nevada, Texas, Virginia, Oregon, and Georgia, CoreWeave is well-positioned to serve enterprises that rely on colocation centers for connectivity to major service providers. Each colocation facility the company chose is in close proximity to CoreWeaveâ€™s leased data centers, where CoreWeave hosts its large GPU clusters and runs large AI models. 

The company has already established itself as a leading AI-focused hyperscaler, poised to meet the growing demand for high-performance computing, particularly GPU-as-a-Service solutions, to support AI workloads at scale. Looking ahead, CoreWeave plans to expand its footprint to 28 locations, with a focus on further U.S. expansion and new international markets in London and Barcelona.
