## Model Components

- __Resources__: Incorporates high-fidelity wind speed and solar irradiance data

- __Technology & Cost__: Utilizes detailed assumptions for technology design and project finance

- __Siting Constraints__: Accounts for physical, regulatory, and environmental restrictions

- __Grid Connection Cost__: Models costs associated with grid interconnection

### Technology and Costs

The following technical and financial parameters serve as the baseline for the supply curve calculations. The model assumes a 30-year capital recovery period with capital expenditure estimates benchmarked for the year 2030.

| PV Array Type | 1-axis tracking            |
| Tilt | 0 degrees                  |
| System Losses | 10.4%                      |
| Inverter Loading Ratio| 1.34                       |
| Capacity Density | 43 MWdc/kmÂ²                |
| Capital Expenditures | 1,042 (2021$/kWac)         |
| Fixed O&M | 18.4 (2021$/kWac/yr)       |
| Fixed Charge Rate | 0.06778                    |

| :----------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Turbine Nameplate | 6 MW                       |
| Rotor Diameter | 170 m                      |
| Hub Height | 115 m                      |
| System Losses | Calculated                 |
| Capacity Density | Calculated                 |
| Capital Expenditures | 1,150 (2021$/kW)           |
| Fixed O&M | 27 (2021$/kW/yr)           |
| Fixed Charge Rate | 0.080373                   |

### Siting Constraints

While clear obstructions like highways and urban areas are easily excluded, the model also navigates more complex land-use challenges.

In the most restrictive scenario, the model applies environmental and national defense considerations in addition to standard exclusions for physical obstacles, protected lands, and regulatory setbacks.

### Grid Connection Costs

The cost of connecting a project to the electrical grid is estimated by:

1. Calculating the cost of a new spur line using a least-cost-path algorithm.

2. Estimating associated network and substation upgrade costs.
