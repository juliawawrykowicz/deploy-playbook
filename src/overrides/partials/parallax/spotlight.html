              Material for MkDocs makes your documentation <strong>instantly
              searchable</strong> with zero effort: say goodbye to costly
              third-party crawler-based solutions that can take hours to update.
              Ship your documentation with a <strong>highly customizable
              </strong> and <strong>blazing fast search</strong> running
              entirely <strong>in the user's browser</strong> at no extra
              cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even better: search inside code blocks, exclude specific sections
              or entire pages, boost important pages in the results and build
              searchable documentation that <strong>works offline</strong>.

              Some examples need more explanation than others, which is why
              Material for MkDocs offers a <strong>unique and elegant</strong>
              way to add <strong>rich text</strong> almost <strong>anywhere in
              a code block</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Code annotations can host formatted <strong>text</strong>,
              <strong>images</strong>, <strong>diagrams</strong>, <strong>code
              blocks</strong>, call-outs, content tabs, even interactive
              elements – basically everything that can be expressed in Markdown
              or HTML. Of course, code annotations <strong>work beautifully on
              mobile</strong> and other touch devices <strong> and can be
              printed</strong>.

              <strong>increase engagement</strong> when sharing links to your
              documentation by leveraging the built-in social plugin.
              Material for MkDocs makes it effortless to generate a
              <strong>beautiful preview image</strong> for each page, which
              will drive more interested users to your Open Source or commercial
              project.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the social plugin uses what's already there, i.e. your
              project's name and logo, as well as each page's title and
              description, it's easy to <strong>customize preview
