            <h2>Value Creation Strategy in Underwriting</h2>
            <p>
              Investors can design cost-effective market-entry strategies with <strong>digital-twin precision — anywhere in the world</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, this model maps a set of satellite-identified buildings against mobile coverage, tower visibility, and fiber node proximity to generate the lowest-cost connectivity path. 
              The model doesn’t just highlight where to go — it shows exactly how to get there, asset by asset, based on local infrastructure realities.
            </p>
            <p>
              A digital twin is a Monopoly board with real assets and precise cost estimates: every building, every fiber route, every signal layer quantified. 
              The strategy is geospatially grounded, commercially prioritized, and ready to deploy where it delivers the most value.

            <h2>Portfolio Value Creation</h2>
            <p>
              To assess attractive markets for fiber expansion or copper upgrades, investors used to focus on traditional mapping of fiber-versus-fiber competition. But the data revealed a shift: <strong>fixed wireless</strong>, long dismissed as too slow, is emerging as a high-capacity rival powered by 5G. In parallel, <strong>cable operators</strong> — once seen as mid-speed players — are rolling out gigabit offerings that challenge fiber’s dominance. This updated view of competitive dynamics uncovered areas where fiber still has a clear edge, shaping a more targeted and forward-looking value creation plan.

            <h2>Dashboards for Rapid Assessment of Targets</h2>
            <p>
              In a fragmented sector, distilling building-level data into actionable insights with high-tech tools can enable <strong>faster screening or a swift validation of claims</strong> — without waiting on a full diligence cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
              With thousands of fiber operators in the US, investors can quickly leverage a dashboard when a CIM arrives or when developing investment ideas.
              For example, the tool can surface the density of the company's footprint, as a proxy for cost competitiveness, or the speed of its broadband product offerings, as a proxy for pricing power.

              Synergies from Co-Locating Clean Power
            </h2>
            <p>
              Investors are zeroing in on a key question: where <strong>clean energy can be deployed 
              most cost-effectively to power data centers</strong>, ideally through co-location. 
            </p>
            <p>
              There’s a growing opportunity to apply advanced geospatial models that identify 
              optimal sites for wind and solar development, factoring in land use, transmission proximity, 
              and long-run generation economics. 
              For data center investors, this means sharper site selection and power strategy: 
              locating assets where clean energy is cheapest, scalable, and most reliable. 
            </p>
